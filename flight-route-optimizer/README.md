# ✈️ Flight Route Optimizer CLI

A command-line Python application that calculates the shortest flight route between two airports using Dijkstra's algorithm.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This project was built to help users find the shortest route between two airports based on a dataset of available flights.  
It simulates how airlines or travel apps might optimize travel routes behind the scenes, and it helped me reinforce concepts like:

- Graph data structures  
- Dijkstra's algorithm  
- Python file I/O and CSV handling  
- Command-line interfaces using `argparse`
